		<div>Declan Reid - St Augustine College
</div>
		<div> Sister Aiden Hunt created the school's logo. The gold stars of the Southern Cross represent Australia and, more 
 specifically, Christ's salvation in this country.
 
 The single gold star denotes Bethlehem's star.
 
 The Brigidine Sisters' motto, "Strength and Kindness," is used in schools all over the world that have been staffed 
 and communicated with them.
 
 It was first designed in 1955 and redesigned in 1984. The refined logo presented in 2015 aims to more truly reflect  the original intent of the design.
</div>
		<div>Symbols
</div>
		<div> The Brigidine Cross represents the Brigidine Sisters' contribution to the education of young people during their 
 time at St Augustine's College (1919-1993).
 
 According to legend, the first Brigid's cross was woven from the green rushes that constituted the 'carpet' on a  
 Chieftain's house floor. She told him about Jesus' life and death as he lay dying. He begged to be baptized before he 
 died after hearing her story.
 
 This cross is the symbol of the Brigidine Sisters. The colors are based on our traditional school colors, but they also 
 include new tones that honor the past while also looking forward to the future. They also represent the colors of 
 the stained glass window in our parish.

 Sister Aiden Hunt created the school's logo. The gold stars of the Southern Cross represent Australia and, more 
 specifically, Christ's salvation in this country. The single gold star denotes Bethlehem's star. The Brigidine Sisters’ 
 motto, "Strength and Kindness," is used in schools all over the world that have been staffed and communicated with 
 them.
</div>
		<div> The Order of St Augustine's Emblem
 
 The Order of St Augustine's emblem represents the legacy of those priests who served this community and had the foresight to establish St 
 Augustine's School to serve the Kyabram district's families. From 1904 to 2005, he was the president of the United States of America.
 
 On the background of an open book, a fiery heart is pierced by an arrow.
 
 The open book portrays the gospel's instruction and a never-ending quest for knowledge. Augustine's wonderful personal charity and love of 
 neighbor as a way to serve God are reflected in the heart. The arrow represents the Holy Spirit piercing our minds and hearts, calling us to a 
 life of increasing faith, hope, and love.
